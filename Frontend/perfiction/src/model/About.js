        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! We are Benjamin Bowo and Jere Saarelma, two individuals with a
          passion for creativity â€” creativity makes us happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We truly believe in the transformative power of illustration and
          design and their ability to simplify communications, elevate
          experiences, engage and inspire people everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>Good design and good relationships come from collaboration.</p>
        <p>
          We're excited to start a visual dialogue, learn about you, and make
          something beautiful together.
        </p>
